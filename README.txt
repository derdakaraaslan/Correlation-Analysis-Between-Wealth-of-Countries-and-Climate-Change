Since notebooks use datasets produced in other notebooks, you should run notebooks in order. 
Otherwise, you may get an error or the results may be incorrect. 
Run the notebooks in the following order.

1 - 1_temp_changes_cleaning_df
2 - 2_temp_changes_visulation_df
3 - 3_co2_emissions_cleaning_df
4 - 4_co2_emissions_analyzing_df
5 - 5_income_change_cleaning_df
6 - 6_income_change_analysing_df
7 - 7_temp_vs_income_analysing_df
8 - 8_temp_change_vs_income_analysing_df
9 - 9_co2_vs_income_kMeans_analysis_df
10 - 10_co2_vs_income_analysis_df


Three data sets were used in this project. 
These datasets and the links that can be accessed are given below. 
For the project to work, all 3 datasets must be in the same folder as the project (the folder where this text document is located). 
If the datasets are not available, please download them from the links below and add them to the folder where this text document is located.
Don't forget! The names of the data sets should be exactly as follows.

1 - city_temperature.csv	: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities
2 - CO2_emission		: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/koustavghosh149/co2-emission-around-the-world
3 - world_country_gdp_usd	: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmishinev/world-country-gdp-19602021

When you start the project, it will create X datasets using these datasets. 
So don't be afraid when you see these datasets :).

1 - cleaned_city_temperature.csv
2 - top_temp.csv
3 - top_temp_diff.csv
4 - cleaned_CO2_emission.csv
5 - top_co2.csv
6 - top_co2_diff.csv
7 - cleaned_income_change.csv
8 - top_income_diff.csv
